# Integration Testing

Ballista has a [benchmark crate](https://github.com/ballista-compute/ballista/tree/main/rust/benchmarks/tpch) which is
derived from TPC-H and this is currently the main form of integration testing. 

The following command can be used to run the integration tests.

```bash
./dev/integration-tests.sh
```

Please refer to the
[benchmark documentation](https://github.com/ballista-compute/ballista/blob/main/rust/benchmarks/tpch/README.md)
for more information.
